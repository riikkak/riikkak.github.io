It is wonderful to have you all on my course! Let us make it memorable, shall we? 

Dear and love, even duck, I hope you learn to trust, all but luck, on your way to the top (of oral communication). Be polite and active and it won't be a disaster. Listen and learn, so when it is your turn, speak up and do it with a smile and you won't  have to tell a lie.

Happy course 8 y'all!

See you later alligator!
